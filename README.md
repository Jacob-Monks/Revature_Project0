# Revature_Project0
This project is a diet and exercise tracker. The goal is to help people document their fitness journey by keeping track of the exercise they do such as weightlifting and jogging, and it also makes sure they are aware of what they are eating by recording the foods they eat. What the User does with this data is entirely up to them, this application merely gives them a means to keep track of and secure this information. They could keep this information to give to their fitness instructor, dietician, or weight loss associate.

3 Tables:

Nutrition Record:
-	This is where the User keeps note of every item they consume and put in data that is pertinent to their fitness program. These include, but are not limited to, calorie count, protein, saturated and unsaturated fats, cholesterol, sodium, essential vitamins, and the date.
-	The application will tally the total amount of calories, etc. that the User has consumed for each day. This is helpful information if the User wants to maintain a particular diet.

Exercise Record:

-	This is where the User will input any physical activity. They will input the date, type of activity (biking, running, doing reps, etc.), and duration of the activity.
-	A possible function of the application is that the program will calculate how many calories were burned each day. This could be done by accessing a fitness database that details the function and effectiveness of each type of exercise (this may or may not be feasible given the scope and time restrictions on this project). This information would also be helpful for the User to know if they are on a calorie deficit or a surplus. The screen can even display messages such as “Good job! You are doing great!” if it notices that the User is exercising more. If the database access proves to be too much, then the application will contain an algorithm for estimating burned calories, based on the research done.

Weight Loss Record:

-	The User will weigh themselves periodically, noting the date and the measurement on their scale. This is important information for all sorts of medical purposes, and it will be useful for people to show their doctors so they can properly diagnose and treat any health problems. Like the exercise table, this chart can make notices appear such as “You are getting closer to your goal!”
